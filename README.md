# plainyr-rev_doi
plainyr-rev_doi BibTeX style
========================

This BibTeX style formats bibliographic entries like the plain style
but sorts them in reverse chronological order, i.e., the newest 
references are listed first.

Implemented doi support.

The style is almost identical to plainyr-rev.bst, but changes only the sorting
order.
